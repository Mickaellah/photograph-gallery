# Front end finals

## Overview

![screenshot](./front_end_finals.jpg)

### Built With

-   [HTML](https://html.com/)
-   [CSS](https://w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
-   [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## What I did

In this project, I work with HTML and CSS to create this photograph page. There is a bit of JavaScript for the images. Getting the right element is the most challenging part and also the stuctures to use. To start the website, you need to create a repository and all the files that are needed. In this project, I used SASS so I needed to change the script attribute in the package.json file for compiling SCSS file into CSS.

## How does it work

When users click on an image, they will see the bigger version of that image. To do that change or that replacement, I used a bit of JavaScript.
