## Overview

![screenshot](./front_end_finals.jpg)

### Built With

-   [HTML](https://html.com/)
-   [CSS](https://w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
-   [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## What I did

This is a HTML and CSS based project which is build to create photograph gallery page. There is a bit of JavaScript add for the images slider. To start the website, you need to create a repository and all the files that are needed. SASS is also used in this project so the script attribute in the package.json file needs to be changed to compile SCSS file into CSS.

## How does it work

Bigger version of each image is going to be seen when clicking on each item. A few lines of Javascript code is added to implement that functionality.

## How To Use
